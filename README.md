_Base template for transversal projects in the AI Engineering Career Program — 4Geeks Academy._

> _Instrucciones disponibles en español en [README.es.md](./README.es.md)._

---

## Purpose

This repository is the **starter template** for transversal projects. You will work on real company scenarios (Brasaland, TrackFlow, Nexova), building deliverables that map to course milestones (Web, Programming, Backend, Telemetry, RAG, Agents, Workflows, Real-time).

- **Create a template** from this repo (do not clone the milestone-specific one).
- Read your **CONTEXT** file for your assigned company — it defines domain data, fields, and constraints.
- Use the **skills/** folder so AI agents can assist you consistently.

## How to start

1. **Fork** this repository to your GitHub account.
2. **Clone** your fork (or open in GitHub Codespaces).
3. **Add your CONTEXT**: copy the `CONTEXT-<company>.md` for your assigned company into the root as `CONTEXT.md`.
4. **Read** `AGENTS.md` so you know which skills are available when working with AI.
5. **Build** your milestone deliverables inside `apps/`, reusing `packages/shared-types` and `pipelines/data` as needed.
